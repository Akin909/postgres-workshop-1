# Postgres Workshop

This workshop is designed to build your confidence in querying data using SQL. We will work through some examples as a group before you tackle the challenges in pairs.

## Loading the dataset

We will be working with the dataset in the `data.sql` file [to be written!]. Please download the file and navigate in the Terminal to its location.

Confirm that you have Postgres installed and running on your computer.

In a separate terminal window or tab run the command `psql --file=data.sql`. This will connect to your Postgres and run all of the SQL in `data.sql`, which will set things up for us.

## The challenges

[TODO - should we have one fairly simple example for each bullet point and then a couple of harder ones for people to work through?]

* Retrieve everything from a table

* Retrieve specific columns

* Retrieve only rows matching a condition

* Search using strings

* Ordering results

* Retrieving the max/min value from a column

* Something requiring inner join

* Something requiring outer join
